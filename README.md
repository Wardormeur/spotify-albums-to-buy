# What is it
This is a yearly review of what ablum you should buy based on your spotify activity. It counts the number of tracks you've liked per albums and order them this way.


## Setup
### LIMITATIONS
Because of Spotify having a non-competition clause for API keys, I cannot provide a live version that will work without me managing your email. I don't want to do that and particularly because it would be limited to 15 people.

### Configuration
You need to create a client key on spotify API and set it in the index.js in the `setLoginUrl` function. Then add your own account to be allowed to use that client.

## Usage
